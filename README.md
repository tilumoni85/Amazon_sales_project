# Project Proposal

## Project topic – 
I chose Amazon prime user dataset for my analysis because I want to uncover business opportunity dependencies on users age, gender, subscription type and study the trends. 

## Business objective – 

•	Analyze how different user demographics, such as age and gender, contribute to Amazon Prime's business growth. This involves examining which segments of the user population are driving the most value and identifying opportunities for tailored marketing strategies.
•	Analyze how subscription types (auto/manual) affect Amazon Prime’s business opportunities
•	Analyze trends (monthly vs annual subscription) to understand user behaviors to retain existing customers for long term business growth. 

## Intended audience – 
As a data analyst at Amazon customer service department, my manager wants me to take the opportunity to use available data to find insights of my data so she can make data driven decisions. 

## Previous research or current knowledge – 
Previously, as a private client banker at a financial institution, I have managed financial activities for high net-worth clients while developing relationships with clients. 

## Project design- 
•	Learn more about the business/ask relevant questions
•	Collect the data
•	Perform data cleaning 
•	Data exploration
•	Data visualization 
•	Present the project 

## Analysis –  
•	Data cleaning -null values, duplicates, missing values, dropping unnecessary columns. 
•	Construct data model using – python, numpy, seaborn
### Some steps are following - 
1.	Convert columns to datetime – Date of birth, membership start date, membership end date.  Then figure out the ages of the users.
2.	Find relation between gender and usage frequency
3.	Find relation between age and engagement metrics
4.	Find relation between renewal status and usage frequency
5.	Find relation between renewal status and purchase history
6.	Find relation between gender and usage frequency
7.	Find relation between subscription plan and usage engagement metrics
8.	Create a new column with different segments of customers to figure out which segment we should focus more for business growth
9.	Save work as csv and upload it to Tableau for final visualization
## Data collection- 
'/kaggle/input/amazon-prime-userbase-dataset/amazon_prime_users.csv

## Intended outcome -  
I think my actionable insights and recommendations will help Amazon optimize user engagement and foster long-term growth.
